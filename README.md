## Features

- **Dynamic Learning:** Analyze code quickly and efficiently, treating each function, struct, or class as a page in a textbook.
- **Rapid Note Population:** Automatically generate notes for each code element, streamlining the learning process.
- **Interactive Chat:** Engage in a chat interface for enhanced interaction and discussion while studying.

## Installation

To install, use the following pip commands:

```bash
pip install tkhtmlview
pip install cssutils
pip install bs4
pip install PyMuPDF
pip install pillow
```

## Additional Setup
### Install Tampermonkey Extension:

1. **Visit the browser's extension store** (e.g., [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)).
2. **Search for "Tampermonkey"** and install the extension.
3. Once installed, you should see the Tampermonkey icon in your browser's toolbar.

### Add Scripts to Tampermonkey:

1. Click on the Tampermonkey icon in your browser's toolbar to open the Tampermonkey dashboard.
2. Select "Dashboard" from the dropdown menu.
3. In the Tampermonkey dashboard, navigate to the "Utilities" tab on the left sidebar.
4. Click on "File" and then select "Import" from the dropdown menu.
5. Copy the raw URL of the script file you want to add. For example:
   - For Alt ChatGPT: [TamperMonkey/Alt ChatGPT](https://github.com/JadanPoll/Jarvis-Code-Textbook-Assistant/raw/main/TamperMonkey/Alt%20ChatGPT)
   - For Alt Phind: [TamperMonkey/Alt Phind](https://github.com/JadanPoll/Jarvis-Code-Textbook-Assistant/raw/main/TamperMonkey/Alt%20Phind)
6. Paste the raw URL into the "URL" field and click "Import".
7. Tampermonkey will then prompt you to review the script. Once you're satisfied, click "Install" to add the script to Tampermonkey.
8. Repeat the process for each script you want to add.

## Usage

Once you have installed the Tampermonkey extension and added the scripts, simply navigate to a Jarvis Code textbook page, and the assistant will provide additional functionality to improve your browsing experience.
