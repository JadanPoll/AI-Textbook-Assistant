Uhh I'm not exactly sure how to put what this does yet, basically it can look at code and then allows you to dynamically and extremely quickly(eventually) learn complete library bases, basically each function/struct/class in the code is a page in the textbook and you can then populate it with notes, The notes are auto done for you and there's chat

## To add later, using cosine similarity, allows you to find similar related snippets based on your query, say Ctrl+F but supercharged

## To add later, implement go to definition and find references similar to Visual Studio Code

## To add later, coloured code
