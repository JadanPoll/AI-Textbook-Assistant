# Jarvis Code Textbook Assistant

**Jarvis Code Textbook Assistant** is a tool designed to facilitate rapid learning and note-taking inspired by the Jarvis AI from Iron Man. Originally created to accelerate code learning, it now extends its functionality to speed up the process of reading and learning from PDF documents. This project aims to provide users with a fast and efficient way to absorb information.

## Features

- **Dynamic Learning:** Analyze code quickly and efficiently, treating each function, struct, or class as a page in a textbook.
- **Rapid Note Population:** Automatically generate notes for each code element, streamlining the learning process.
- **Interactive Chat:** Engage in a chat interface for enhanced interaction and discussion while studying.

## Installation

To install, use the following pip commands:

```bash
pip install tkhtmlview
pip install cssutils
pip install bs4
pip install PyMuPDF
pip install pillow
```

## Additional Setup

For additional functionality, follow these steps:

1. Install the Tampermonkey extension in your browser.
2. Insert the following scripts into Tampermonkey:

   - [TamperMonkey/Alt ChatGPT](script_url1)
   - [TamperMonkey/Alt Phind](script_url2)

# More to come:
## Advanced Search with Cosine Similarity
- **Similar Snippet Retrieval:** Utilize cosine similarity to find related code snippets based on your queries, offering a supercharged alternative to traditional searching (like Ctrl+F).

## IDE-Like Functionality
- **Go to Definition:** Implement a feature similar to Visual Studio Code, allowing users to navigate directly to the definition of a code element.
- **Find References:** Enhance your coding experience by easily locating references to specific code elements.

## Coloured Code for Improved Visualization
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Add colored code functionality for better visualization and comprehension.

## Futuristic UI Inspired by Jarvis in Iron Man's Helmet
- **Functional Design:** Aim for a user interface reminiscent of Jarvis in Iron Man's helmet, offering a seamless and intuitive coding experience.
- **Quick Analysis:** Analyze code, images, and other elements swiftly, providing relevant information on the spot.

## Image Processing and 3D Model Generation
- **Spectral Decomposition:** Take images and generate spectral decompositions, offering a unique perspective on visual data.
- **3D Model Conversion:** Convert images, such as drone photos, into 3D models, allowing for creative exploration and manipulation.
