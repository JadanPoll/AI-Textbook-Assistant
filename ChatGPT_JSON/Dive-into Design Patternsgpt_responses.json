Here\u2019s how it works:\n</p>\n<h4>\n Key Concept\n</h4>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Identify Variability\n  </strong>\n  : Determine which aspects of your application are likely to change and separate them from the stable components. This helps in minimizing the impact of those changes.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n Analogy\n</h4>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Ship and Mines\n  </strong>\n  : Think of your program as a ship and changes as underwater mines. If the ship hits a mine, it could sink.\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    To mitigate this risk, divide the ship\u2019s hull into\n    <strong>\n     independent compartments\n    </strong>\n    that can be sealed. This way, if one compartment is damaged, the entire ship remains afloat.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n Application to Software\n</h4>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Isolate Variable Parts\n  </strong>\n  : Similarly, isolate the components of your program that are likely to change into\n  <strong>\n   independent modules\n  </strong>\n  . This protects the stable parts of your code from any adverse effects caused by changes.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n Benefits\n</h4>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Reduced Downtime\n  </strong>\n  : By encapsulating variability, you spend less time fixing issues and more time developing new features. This leads to a more efficient development process.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n Conclusion\n</h3>\n<p>\n Encapsulating what varies allows you to manage changes effectively, protecting the stability of your application while facilitating easier updates and feature implementation.\n</p>\n"}}
