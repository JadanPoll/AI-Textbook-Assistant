We\nwill provide notes in this format to supplement the textbook for this purpose. In order to make these notes\nmore useful as a reference, de\ufb01nitions are highlighted with boldface, and italicization emphasizes pitfalls\nor other important points. Sections marked with an asterisk are provided solely for your interest, but you\nprobably need to learn this material in later classes.\nThese notes are broken up into four parts, corresponding to the three midterm exams and the \ufb01nal exam.\nEach part is covered by one examination in our class. The last section of each of the four parts gives you\na summary of material that you are expected to know for the corresponding exam. Feel free to read it in\nadvance.\nAs discussed in the textbook and in class, a universal computational device (or computing machine)\nis a device that is capable of computing the solution to any problem that can be computed, provided that\nthe device is given enough storage and time for the computation to \ufb01nish.\nOne might ask whether we can describe problems that we cannot answer (other than philosophical ones,\nsuch as the meaning of life). The answer is yes: there are problems that are provably undecidable, for\nwhich no amount of computation can solve the problem in general. This set of notes describes the \ufb01rst\nproblem known to be undecidable, the halting problem. For our class, you need only recognize the name\nand realize that one can, in fact, give examples of problems that cannot be solved by computation. In the fu-\nture, you should be able to recognize this type of problem so as to avoid spending your time trying to solve it.\n1.1.1\nUniversal Computing Machines*\nThe things that we call computers today, whether we are talking about a programmable microcontroller in\na microwave oven or the Blue Waters supercomputer sitting on the south end of our campus (the United\nStates\u2019 main resource to support computational science research), are all equivalent in the sense of what\nproblems they can solve. These machines do, of course, have access to di\ufb00erent amounts of memory, and\ncompute at di\ufb00erent speeds.\nThe idea that a single model of computation could be described and proven to be equivalent to all other\nmodels came out of a 1936 paper by Alan Turing, and today we generally refer to these devices as Turing\nmachines. All computers mentioned earlier, as well as all computers with which you are familiar in your\ndaily life, are provably equivalent to Turing machines.\nTuring also conjectured that his de\ufb01nition of computable was identical to the \u201cnatural\u201d de\ufb01nition (today,\nthis claim is known as the Church-Turing conjecture). In other words, a problem that cannot be solved\nby a Turing machine cannot be solved in any systematic manner, with any machine, or by any person. This\nconjecture remains unproven! However, neither has anyone been able to disprove the conjecture, and it is\nwidely believed to be true. Disproving the conjecture requires that one demonstrate a systematic technique\n(or a machine) capable of solving a problem that cannot be solved by a Turing machine. No one has been\nable to do so to date.\n1.1.2\nThe Halting Problem*\nYou might reasonably ask whether any problems can be shown to be incomputable. More common terms\nfor such problems\u2014those known to be insolvable by any computer\u2014are intractable or undecidable. In the\nsame 1936 paper in which he introduced the universal computing machine, Alan Turing also provided an\nanswer to this question by introducing (and proving) that there are in fact problems that cannot be computed\nby a universal computing machine. The problem that he proved undecidable, using proof techniques almost\nidentical to those developed for similar problems in the 1880s, is now known as the halting problem.\n": {"response": "\n<p>\n The Church-Turing conjecture, also known as the Church-Turing thesis, is a foundational concept in computer science and mathematical logic.

Examples include your laptop, desktop, or even a supercomputer.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Turing Machines\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    A\n    <strong>\n     Turing machine\n    </strong>\n    is a simple theoretical model created by Alan Turing. Imagine it as a very basic computer that reads and writes symbols on an infinite tape. Turing machines help us understand what problems can be solved by any computer.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Church-Turing Conjecture\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    This is the idea that if a problem can\u2019t be solved by a Turing machine, then it can\u2019t be solved by any computer or method. It\u2019s like saying if you can\u2019t unlock a door with a key, you won\u2019t be able to open it with any other tool either.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>\n What Makes the Halting Problem Special?\n</h4>\n<ol>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    The Question\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    Can we create a program that takes another program and its input, and tells us if that program will eventually stop running or continue forever?\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Turing's Proof\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    Turing proved that it\u2019s impossible to write such a program. No matter how clever you are, there will always be some programs for which you can't tell if they will stop or not.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>\n Example to Illustrate\n</h4>\n<p>\n Imagine you have a program that counts from 1 to 10:\n</p>\nc\nCopy code\n<code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-c\">\n for\n (\n int\n i =\n 1\n ; i &lt;=\n 10\n ; i++) {\n printf\n (\n \"%d\\n\"\n , i);\n}\n</code>\n<p>\n This program will definitely stop after printing numbers 1 through 10.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, consider a program that looks like this:\n</p>\nc\nCopy code\n<code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-c\">\n while\n (\n true\n ) {\n // do nothing\n }\n</code>\n<p>\n This program will run forever because it has no stopping condition.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Halting Problem asks if you can create a program that can look at any random program (like the two examples) and decide whether it will stop or run forever. Turing showed that no such program can exist for all possible programs.\n</p>\n<h4>\n Why Does It Matter?\n</h4>\n<ol>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Limits of Computation\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    Understanding the Halting Problem helps us recognize the limits of what computers can do. Some problems simply can't be solved by any algorithm or program.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Real-World Implications\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    This has practical implications in fields like software development, where you may encounter bugs or infinite loops that are hard to detect. Knowing there are limits to what can be determined helps programmers focus on solvable problems.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n In summary, the Halting Problem reveals important truths about computation: some questions are fundamentally unanswerable, and it teaches us to be cautious about the limits of what computers can solve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Yes, that's a great way to think about it! The\n <strong>\n  Halting Problem\n </strong>\n serves as a specific edge case that highlights the fundamental limits of computation.\n</p>\n<h3>\n Key Points:\n</h3>\n<ol>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Limits of Computation\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    The Halting Problem shows that there are certain questions\u2014like whether a given program will finish running\u2014that cannot be answered by any algorithm or computer. This means that, no matter how advanced our technology becomes, there will always be some problems we cannot solve.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Not Just an Edge Case\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    While the Halting Problem is a specific example, it illustrates a broader principle: some problems are undecidable, meaning that no systematic method exists to find an answer. It\u2019s not just an isolated case; it reveals a class of problems that are inherently unsolvable.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Implications for Computer Science\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    Understanding the Halting Problem helps programmers and computer scientists set realistic expectations about what can and cannot be computed. It encourages focusing on problems that are computable and solvable rather than those that are fundamentally unsolvable.\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n In summary, the Halting Problem is a crucial example that defines the boundaries of what computers can do, demonstrating that some questions lie beyond the reach of computation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Certainly! Besides the\n <strong>\n  Halting Problem\n </strong>\n , there are several other important edge cases and concepts in computer science that illustrate the limits of computation. Here are a few notable examples:\n</p>\n<h3>\n 1.\n <strong>\n  The Entscheidungsproblem (Decision Problem)\n </strong>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Description\n  </strong>\n  : This was a challenge posed by David Hilbert asking whether there is a systematic method to determine the truth of any mathematical statement.\n </li>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Outcome\n  </strong>\n  : Alan Turing and Alonzo Church proved that there is no general algorithm that can solve all instances of this problem, emphasizing the limits of formal systems.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n 2.\n <strong>\n  Rice's Theorem\n </strong>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Description\n  </strong>\n  : This theorem states that any non-trivial property of the language recognized by a Turing machine is undecidable. In simpler terms, if you want to determine whether a Turing machine has a specific behavior or property (like whether it accepts certain inputs), there\u2019s no algorithm that can solve all cases.\n </li>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Example\n  </strong>\n  : Determining whether a program will always output \"true\" for all inputs is a non-trivial property and is undecidable.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n 3.\n <strong>\n  The Post Correspondence Problem\n </strong>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Description\n  </strong>\n  : This problem involves finding a sequence of pairs of strings that can produce the same string when concatenated. Given two sets of strings, the challenge is to determine if there\u2019s a way to select some of these pairs to create a match.\n </li>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Outcome\n  </strong>\n  : It has been proven that there is no general algorithm to solve this problem for all instances.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n 4.\n <strong>\n  The Busy Beaver Problem\n </strong>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Description\n  </strong>\n  : This problem asks for the maximum number of steps that a Turing machine with a given number of states can take before halting.\n </li>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Outcome\n  </strong>\n  : While you can compute Busy Beaver numbers for small cases, it becomes increasingly uncomputable as the number of states increases, leading to non-computable values.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n 5.\n <strong>\n  Deciding Equality of Context-Free Grammars\n </strong>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Description\n  </strong>\n  : The question of whether two context-free grammars generate the same language is undecidable.\n </li>\n <li>\n  <strong>\n   Outcome\n  </strong>\n  : There is no algorithm that can determine for every pair of context-free grammars if they produce the same set of strings.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n Summary\n</h3>\n<p>\n These edge cases all highlight the boundaries of what can be computed or decided algorithmically. They serve as important reminders in computer science, illustrating that not every problem has a solution that can be achieved through computation, and they guide researchers in understanding the limitations of algorithms.\n</p>\n"}, "1.2\nThe 2\u2019s Complement Representation\n5\nIn fact, we can choose any single value for each pattern to create a representation, and our add unit will\nalways produce results that are correct modulo 16. Look back at our over\ufb02ow example, where we added 12\nand 6 to obtain 2, and notice that (2 = 18) mod 16. Normally, only a contiguous sequence of integers makes\na useful representation, but we do not have to restrict ourselves to non-negative numbers.\nThe 2\u2019s complement representation can then be de\ufb01ned by choosing a set of integers balanced around zero\nfrom the groups. In the circle diagram, for example, we might choose to represent numbers in the range\n[\u22127, 7] when using 4 bits. What about the last pattern, 1000? We could choose to represent either -8 or 8.\nThe number of arithmetic operations that over\ufb02ow is the same with both choices (the choices are symmetric\naround 0, as are the combinations of input operands that over\ufb02ow), so we gain nothing in that sense from ei-\nther choice. If we choose to represent -8, however, notice that all patterns starting with a 1 bit then represent\nnegative numbers. No such simple check arises with the opposite choice, and thus an N-bit 2\u2019s complement\nrepresentation is de\ufb01ned to represent the range [\u22122N\u22121, 2N\u22121\u22121], with patterns chosen as shown in the circle.\n1.2.5\nAn Algebraic Approach\nSome people prefer an algebraic approach to understanding the de\ufb01nition of 2\u2019s complement, so we present\nsuch an approach next. Let\u2019s start by writing f(A, B) for the result of our add unit:\nf(A, B) = (A + B) mod 2N\nWe assume that we want to represent a set of integers balanced around 0 using our signed representation, and\nthat we will use the same binary patterns as we do with an unsigned representation to represent non-negative\nnumbers. Thus, with an N-bit representation, the patterns in the range [0, 2N\u22121 \u22121] are the same as those\nused with an unsigned representation. In this case, we are left with all patterns beginning with a 1 bit.\nThe question then is this: given an integer k, 2N\u22121 > k > 0, for which we want to \ufb01nd a pattern to\nrepresent \u2212k, and any integer m \u22650 that we might want to add to \u2212k, can we \ufb01nd another integer p > 0\nsuch that\n(\u2212k + m = p + m) mod 2N\n?\n(1)\nIf we can, we can use p\u2019s representation to represent \u2212k and our unsigned addition unit f(A, B) will work\ncorrectly.\nTo \ufb01nd the value p, start by subtracting m from both sides of Equation (1) to obtain:\n(\u2212k = p) mod 2N\n(2)\nNote that (2N = 0) mod 2N, and add this equation to Equation (2) to obtain\n(2N \u2212k = p) mod 2N\nLet p = 2N \u2212k. For example, if N = 4, k = 3 gives p = 16 \u22123 = 13, which is the pattern 1101. With N = 4\nand k = 5, we obtain p = 16 \u22125 = 11, which is the pattern 1011. In general, since 2N\u22121 > k > 0, we\nhave 2N\u22121 < p < 2N. But these patterns are all unused\u2014they all start with a 1 bit!\u2014so the patterns that\nwe have de\ufb01ned for negative numbers are disjoint from those that we used for positive numbers, and the\nmeaning of each pattern is unambiguous. The algebraic de\ufb01nition of bit patterns for negative numbers also\nmatches our circle diagram from the last section exactly, of course.\n": {"response": "\n<p>\n The term\n <strong>\n  2's complement\n </strong>\n refers to the method used to represent negative binary numbers.
